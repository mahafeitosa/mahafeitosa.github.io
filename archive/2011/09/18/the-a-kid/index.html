				<p>Back in 2004 a friend of mine <q>made me</q> listen to this weird album by this weird band that so far I had only listened to Fake Plastic Trees and Paranoid Android. Instantly amazed by Track 8, Track 8? Oh, Idioteque, thatâ€™s the one.</p>
				
				<p>I can never chose a favourite Radiohead album, but if someone play the <em>Choose 5 albums you would take to the lonely island to listen for the rest of your life</em>, with me, I would probably choose Kid A 3 times at least, just in case the other two get ruined with time. Although I really wish that the track Treefingers would be 30 or more minutes long, 4 minutes is not enough of this ethereal, smooth track, so I always end up leaving it on repeat for a certain amount of time.</p>
				
				<p>So, listening to this 55 minutes single track, Kid A, I close my Sunday, which was pretty much on top of a bicycle.</p>
