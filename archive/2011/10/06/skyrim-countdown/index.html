				<p>For months I avoided posting things related to Skyrim. Why? I don’t really know, I guess 
				I like just to read about it. My story with The Elder Scrolls started only in Morrowind, but I did 
				not play 5% of it, at the time I was too busy doing Baalruns in Diablo II, but one day I decided to watch 
				a friend playing Oblivion and, as an avid RPG (AD&amp;D, 3D&amp;T, GURPS etc…) player, I instantly 
				fell in love with it. All the details and the <strong>massive</strong> world to roam around, freedom to do pretty much
				whatever you want to do. So, a few months later I was buying a PS3 and Oblivion game of the year edition, 
				played many many hours of it and still did not finish all of it, reason I am playing all over again.</p>
				
				<p>Skyrim, doubtless will <strong>blow</strong> my mind, even if it comes with Justin Bieber as the soundtrack composer 
				(sorry Jeremy Soule), I will still love it the same. I am way over excited about its release and soon 
				I shall pre-order this game.</p>
				
				<p>With the arrival of Skyrim I will have to struggle with a few things like not loosing my job, eating and 
				bathing, seeing sun shining... xD</p>
				
				<p>So here I am staring at this image, following the numbers going down, soon the wait will be over, 
				and we shall slay some dragons and try to find the highest mountain, perhaps bring the nord version 
				of the Adoring Fan up there and show him the way down : )</p>
