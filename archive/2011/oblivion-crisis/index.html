				<p>Now I know why Redguards are quite robust but at the same time so agile. The secret behind those sturdy muscles are the hours they spend patiently practicing yoga.</p>
								
				<p>As Exu (The Khajiit) walked back from his daily morning hunt for slaughterfish in the shores of Lake Rumare, he noticed something quite unusual in the distance. What first looked like the casual stinky-breathed bandits trying to earn some easy coin, turned out to be peaceful yogis.</p>
				
				<p>Stealthily, Exu approached the, so far, uncommon situation. With one hand in his steel dagger and the other stroking his whiskers in curiosity, he got closer to the folks. For they seemed very focused on their exercise, Exu kept on with his slaughterfish hunt, but couldn't help wonder what he had just seen.</p>

				<p>A few days later, while washing his clothes on a stream of water, he sees that same one sight of a Redguard doing his practises. This time he approaches intending to get to know better and possibly become an initiate. Once again, no attention was given to him. Not a word nor advices. He realised that if he wanted to become a yogi, he would have to learn it by himself. Perhaps watching from a distance, or searching for old books on the matter.</p>
