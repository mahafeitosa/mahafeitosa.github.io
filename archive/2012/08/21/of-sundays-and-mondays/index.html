				<h1 class="post-title">Of Sundays &amp; Mondays</h1>
				
				<p>Thinking back about my school time, one thing I remember clearly is how much 
				free time I used to have. Our classes would start at 7am and finish at 12pm, after that, 
				I had the whole afternoon and evening free to do my homework, hang out with friends, play 
				with my band, climb trees, surf, draw my RPG maps and so on.
				I had so much free time that the weekends seemed like a big holiday, something to be 
				celebrated with all the friends together, football at the beach, playing video games or 
				doing short travels around the county.</p>
				
				<p>Since I started working full time back in mid 2010, my routine has obviously changed a lot, 
				but  since we humans come with a lovely perk called Adapt, it wasn’t a difficult task to get used. 
				Monday to Saturday, waking up at 5:30am, starting work at 8am, finishing at 6pm and going bed at 10pm. 
				I really like my work and by no means I am complaining about it. This is actually me, realising how I 
				have praised Sundays for the past two years. Now, I do most of those things i used to do on my free week 
				days at school time, but all in a single day, the Sunday. Ride my bike early in the morning, go surfing 
				for a couple of hours, cook with my mother, play games, listen to music in the back room, walk around my 
				town and lay on a rock to see the sunset. That’s  basically it. And I love it. All of that gives me a 
				lot of disposition and will to wake up early on Monday and start it all over again.</p>
				
				<p>I could not help analysing this after a chat I had with some friends and hearing one of them 
				mentioning Sundays being a very dull and boring day with nothing interesting going on, and after 
				this dull Sunday there is a Monday. And how this friend found it weird the fact I see Sundays and 
				Mondays in a totally opposite way. But then, we all have different routines and things to do, 
				days we enjoy more than others (?)<br/>
				 … I don’t know.</p>
