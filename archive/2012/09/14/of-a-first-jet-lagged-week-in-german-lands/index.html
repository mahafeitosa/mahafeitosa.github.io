				<h1 class="post-title">Of a first jet-lagged week in German lands</h1>
				
				<p>After 2h45 minutes flying, I arrived in Hamburg, at around 22:00. 
				Found my backpack, put my jacket on and went out to meet my girlfriend 
				who was waiting at the arrival. We took the subway and decided to stop a few stops earlier 
				to see if we could find something to drink and spend some time. We dropped off at Altona’s 
				station and walked around, I could not help noticing how silent it was, I mean, very silent. 
				Maybe it was strangely too silent for me because I spent the previous 24 hours or so, inside 
				airplanes and airports… Oh well… So we continued walking at a dry and chilled night (14ºC), 
				nice sights, different airs, many people on bicycles, bus stops showing a countdown for the next bus… 
				stopped for a mandatory KitKat Chunky break and as we left the shop, I sighted a few posters 
				on a wall across the street…</p>

				<p>That is how I found out what I would be doing on the following Saturday, Rock Spektakel, 
				Skindred together with Smoke Blow and a lot of other bands, many local bands, 
				and many I haven’t heard about. I also spotted this, which I believe to be owned by my good 
				friend and bandmate Sapo "Sabido". </p>

				<p>So, next morning, waking up at 11am, seeing sunshine (not really, quite cloudy) for the 
				first time in Hamburg, I had a lovely cold shower, had brunch, put some layers on and went 
				off to the city centre with my girlfriend and city guide, Neele…</p>

				<p>We walked around the centre and visited a few interesting places, went into the Rathaus 
				which has stunning and very detailed architecture and massive old paintings inside, 
				had a thunfisch sandwich at the Alster watching the angry looking swans going by and staring 
				at your food, and then coming back and repeating the procedure until you either finish or walk 
				away in fear. Also visited the Mönckebergstraße, one of the most busy streets in the centre of 
				Hamburg, with many different sorts of shops, and street musicians…</p>
				
				<p>Later in the evening, we headed to the Rathausmarkt where Rock Spektakel took place. 
				Skindred was about to come up and the place was packed, got a good spot near the stage 
				and enjoyed an awesome gig, with a remix of Star Wars’ Imperial March as intro. 
				A couple of drunk german dudes pulled my dreads and asked if they were real and how long 
				they take to grow, asked if they could feel them and it was quite funny to see their faces 
				as I let them feel it and straight after I suddenly barked at their faces making them jump 
				back frightened and laughing</p>
				
				<p>Concert finished, subway back home… Tried to go to sleep but no luck, fell asleep at around 
				1:30 and there my cough and cold started. Yes, my first week was greeted with a cold running 
				nose, and a dog-like cough, turning the jet lag a little bit more challenging.</p>
				
				<p>Next day, Sunday, and Woah! It was sunny, so we got on bikes and went out riding around 6km…</p>
				
				<p><img src="/archive/2012/09/14/of-a-first-jet-lagged-week-in-german-lands/img/first-week-in-german-lands-10.jpg" alt="first-week-in-german-lands-10"></p>
				
				<p>…down to the Elbe river and passing by this big and open park with ancient Ent-looking trees, the Jenischpark.</p>
				
				<p><img src="/archive/2012/09/14/of-a-first-jet-lagged-week-in-german-lands/img/first-week-in-german-lands-11.jpg" alt="first-week-in-german-lands-11"></p>
				
				<p>And finally getting to the Elbe, lots of people enjoying the, not so often, sunshine. 
				Massive container ships coming in and out of countless harbours at the other side of the Elbe, 
				tourists ferries doing tours… We got a spot near the Alte Schwede, drank some water enjoying 
				the view and listening to some nice songs.</p>

				<h2>Facts:</h2>
				
				<p>&dash; Pedestrians/bike riders, do not cross the street when the pedestrian light is red, 
				not even if it is 2 in the morning and it is cold and you can not wait to get home. You wait.</p>
				
				<p>&dash; Orange juice costs &euro;3,20, and it tastes quite good, though, the amount served is very small. Kein Zucker, bitte.</p>
				
				<p>Word of the day: <em>Kaputt</em>, meaning broken or ruined. KAPUTT!</p>
				
				<p>Até breve : )</p>
