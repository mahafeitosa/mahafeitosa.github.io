				<h1 class="post-title">I used to be an adventurer like you...</h1>
				
				<p>...then I lost my Skyrim save game on level 46 and 105 hours. :' (</p>
				
				<p>This past weekend I had some friends over and really wanted to show them the beauty of Skyrim
				and why I have been spending so much time playing it.</p>
				
				<p>So off we went. I wanted them to feel the arrival in Skyrim as a prisoner, the way you are freed,
				and all that epicness, so I chose to start a new game. The experience was very nice and most of them 
				were quite impressed with what they saw. After a while I decided to raise the level and show them my 
				advanced character, the level 46 Khajiit Exu, which I have been playing since the arrival of the game.</p>
				
				<p>Pressed Start, went to load saved games. . . Where is the save game? :O I realised what I have done.
				Speechless, I turned off the console and went to mourn. I couldn't believe it. All those 105 hours, 
				locations discovered and cleaned, items found, skills raised, shouts and spells learnt, all of that 
				became a void, it felt like part of me was gone.</p>
				
				<p>Sadly I lost the will to start over again, I don't know when that will happen. R.I.P.</p>
