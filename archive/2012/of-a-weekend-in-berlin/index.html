				<h1 class="post-title">Of a weekend in Berlin</h1>
				
				<p>The end of September was coming closer, and with it, my travel to Berlin. Here is a short report.</p>
				
				<h3>Friday</h3>
				
				<p>Alarm goes off at 5:00, breakfast, last check-check and off to the bus station. Our bus to Berlin departed at 7:07, was still dark and the first lights of the sun were just appearing behind the buildings ahead. The journey took about 3 hours, circa 290km of fields and more fields.</p>
				
				<p>Arriving in Berlin with a bright sun up but still quite chilly, we walked to the nearest S-bahn and learnt our way to the centre. For someone who is not very used to using subways and trains (a.k.a. myself), the <em>S-bahn</em> and <em>U-bahn</em> can be quite confusing at first, but with a little time and effort (and perhaps, a helpful iPhone app), things get less complicated. <em>Brandenburger Tor</em> station was our starting point, from there we walked around most of the well known places but also the small weird looking streets.</p>
				 
				<p>Walking around Berlin and seeing all those things I have studied about at school, seen in books, watched on documentaries or films was quite an experience…</p>

				<small>Berliner Dom</small></p>
				
				<p>After around 6 hours walking and seeing things, legs were asking for a little rest, so why not take a nap on that nice and green grass in front of Berliner Dom? We still had 2 hours of waiting until we could check in at the rented flat through 
				<a class="link-underline" href="http://www.wimdu.co.uk" target="_blank">Wimdu</a>, so we took the Berlin Bus line 100 which is the Berlin sightseeing tour for &euro;2.30 and hoped to see some more things we haven’t before, but for some reason this one bus had to go a different way due to some traffic problems or something, still was a a good tour.</p>
				
				<p>Back to the S/U-bahn and iPhone app, finding our way to the flat wasn’t so difficult. Arrive > Eat > Shower > Sleep.</p>
				
				<h3>Saturday</h3>
				
				<p>More interesting walks, posters for some amazing upcoming shows and nice street art…</p>

				<p><img src="/archive/2012/of-a-weekend-in-berlin/img/weekend-berlin-10.jpg" alt="weekend-berlin-10"></p>
				
				<p>And a stop for some nice Falafels</p>
				
				<p><img src="/archive/2012/of-a-weekend-in-berlin/img/weekend-berlin-11.jpg" alt="weekend-berlin-11"></p>
				
				<p>And well… Time was coming… Time to head to Wuhlheide to see some band called Radiohead and Caribou as supporting… Getting there in good time so we could get a good spot. All in all, we stood up for around 5 hours, there was rain, rainbows and full moon. And Radiohead! Bloody hell! Was I Hyper?</p>

				<p>Woah! What an amazing concert and setlist.</p>

				<h3>Sunday</h3>
				
				<p>Waking up still in disbelief, got things ready and left the flat at the check out time. Back to Berlin’s centre, we dropped off at <em>Potsdamer Platz</em> station and walked around that area.</p>
				
				<p><img src="/archive/2012/of-a-weekend-in-berlin/img/weekend-berlin-16.jpg" alt="weekend-berlin-16">
				<small>East/West division</small></p>
				
				<p><img src="/archive/2012/of-a-weekend-in-berlin/img/weekend-berlin-17.jpg" alt="weekend-berlin-17">
				<small>Memorial to the murdered jews of Europe</small></p>
				
				<p>Just as you leave <em>Potsdamer Platz</em> station you can’t help noticing some quite high buildings around, and one of them is the <a class="link-underline" href="http://www.panoramapunkt.de/en/kollhoff-tower.html" target="_blank">Kollhoff tower</a>. Paying a fee of &euro;5 you get to go inside, use the fastest elevator in Europa, which goes 90 metres or 24 floors in 20 seconds, visit the cafe and have a really amazing panorama view of Berlin.</p>

				<small>View of Berlin from Panoramanpunkt KollHoff Tower</small></p>
				
				<p>And as the sun was going down, we decided to spend the last few hours we had left at the cold shore of the river Spree. Hopefully we will see you again sometime Berlin.</p>
