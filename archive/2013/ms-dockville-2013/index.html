				<h1 class="post-title">MS Dockville 2013</h1>
				
				<p>Every year since 2007, the district of Wilhelmsburg in Hamburg hosts the music and art festival <a class="link-underline" href="http://msdockville.de" target="_blank">MS Dockville</a>. This year, with around 25,000 visitors and more than 130 bands and DJ's, I finally attended my first music festival and I loved it.</p>

				<p>With tickets in hand, sun glasses in pocket and jacket over shoulder (Yes! Hamburg&#39;s unpredictable weather) my girlfriend and I headed to Wilhelmsburg, a district around 45 minutes by train from where we live, to get surrounded by good music, new faces, arts and… Docks. The scenery is really nice, by the side of the Elbe River, with many old-looking dock buildings on the other side, which would get images projected at night time and occasionally ships passing by.</p>

				<p>The festival was divided in 8 stages and spaces. From the big main stage to the different chilling areas with ambient or electronic music playing all day long. It also had an art camp with many tents showcasing mostly hand crafted art applied in a diversity of things and were available to buy.</p>

				<p>Throughout the weekend, we were very excited about the Festival as a whole, but especially to see some bands we like from up close.</p>
				
				<p><em>Stealing Sheep, Pascal Pinon, HAIM, The Lumineers, When Saints Go Machine, Crystal Fighters, Fuck Art Lets Dance, and the most anticipated, Foals.</em></p>

				<p>I concluded that the festival had a very nice "vibe" all over, many great artists playing all day, finding out new bands, seeing all sorts of people… And as the down side, it can be quite tiring walking around all day, and sometimes standing up for hours so you can get a good spot up front the stage for a band you really like and want to see from up close. Also, as I expected, drinks and food costs a lot. As we Brazilians say "the eyes of the face" (Os olhos da cara). Though, for each plastic cup collected and returned to the bar, you would get 1 euro back. Since some people would buy their drinks and simply throw the cup away, we managed to find a total of 9 precious cups or 9 euro, which paid for some of our expenses during the festival.</p>
				
				<p>Now, looking forward to the line up of 2014 and see if it is worth going.</p>
