				<h1 class="post-title">Visiting the west Jutland</h1>
				
				<p>For the past five days, my wife and I were visiting the west coast of Denmark, more precisely, the area around the <a class="post-text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringkøbing_Fjord" target="_blank"> Ringkøbing fjord</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The trip started at 6:30. She driving, me co-piloting. Even though I can't drive (yet), the roads in Denmark seemed quite easy and chilled to drive by. With many signs easy to follow, enough space for everyone, respectful drivers. After around 360km in 4 hours and 30 minutes, we arrived at our destination with the sea air, white dunes, blue skies and a nice sun above greeting us.</p>

				<p>Luckily, the five days were always sunny with temperatures between 19°C and 22°C. Making it favourable for bike rides, and laying on the beach sand. Although, I didn't feel brave enough to swim in the 10°C sea water.</p>
				
				<p>We stayed in a camping site near the town of <a class="post-text" href="http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hvide_Sande" target="_blank">Hvide Sande</a>. I found this stretch of land quite peculiar for having in one side the North Sea and the other side the fjord so close, and from above the dunes, one could see both.</p>

				<p>One of the most interesting things though were the <a class="post-text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Wall" target="_blank">bunkers</a> on the beach sand. These bunkers were used in the WWII. Thousands of them were built by the nazi Germans along the Atlantic Ocean coast, which was called the Atlantic wall. So it was very interesting seeing and going inside and above some of these buildings and experience a piece of history.</p>

				<p>On the way back we decided to leave a bit earlier so we could stop by the city of Kolding and see a little bit of it.</p>
