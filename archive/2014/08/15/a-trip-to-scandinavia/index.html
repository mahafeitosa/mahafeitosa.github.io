				<h1 class="post-title">A trip to Scandinavia</h1>
				
				<p>Two weeks ago, Neele and I left our home and went on a road trip passing by Denmark, Sweden and Norway. 
				Using a Citroën Berlingo as our mobile home, we drove (she driving) approximately 2600km without a fixed 
				plan of where to go or stop the next day. Of course we had set a few things that we wanted to visit, but 
				most of the places we stayed and visited were decided just as we went by. Here is a little bit of our experience.</p>
				
				<p><img src="img/a-trip-to-scandinavia-1.jpg" alt="a-trip-to-scandinavia-1"></p>
				
				<p>Leaving Hamburg at 6:30, we drove north until Kolding, in Denmark, then turned right in the Direction 
				of Odense. At around 12:00 we reached Copenhagen, the first city we stopped to visit. Since we entered the 
				city, two things could be noticed in great amount: A lot of blond people (sometimes the hair being so blond 
				that looked nearly white), and a lot of cyclists. I mean a lot.</p>
				
				<p>After spending a while to find a parking spot, we finally got out of the car and stretched our legs walking 
				around the city centre seeing a lot of interesting buildings through narrow streets, we reached the Rosenborg 
				garden and stopped to have lunch and a nap and also look around the Rosenborg Castle.</p>

				<p>As it was getting late, we decided to start looking in our maps for a place to spend the night. 
				After going through the underwater tunnel followed by Øresund bridge, we reached Sweden. It didn’t 
				take us long to find a nice and quiet spot by the sea near the town of Höllviken. We settled for the 
				day and went to swim in the sea with water as warm as 25ºC.</p>

				<em>Foggy morning south of Malmö</em></p>
				
				<p>Waking up to a very foggy morning, we had breakfast and drove up to Malmö. By the time we arrived there, 
				it was already quite sunny and warm. We visited the city centre and the coast area near the Turning Torso building.</p>
				
				<p>All together we spent 3 days in Sweden. Visiting places like Malmö, Båstad, Göteborg, Stenungsund and Strømstad 
				and driving always north near the coast until Oslo.</p>

				<p>From the big cities we were going to pass by, Oslo was the one I was looking forward the most to visit, 
				however, we had a bit of a stress to enter and to leave the city. Entering Oslo was quite confusing and we 
				ended up driving to the wrong direction quite far from the centre. When we finally reached the city centre 
				and parked, we made the mistake of parking right in the middle of the city, where the prices are humongous. 
				After visiting some places we wanted to see, we kept driving out of the city in the direction of Hønefoss and 
				found a nice place to stay just before the main town.</p>

				<p>Our plan was to reach Oslo and then drive around the south of Norway until we reach Kristiansand. 
				We started our way down driving through Notodden and visiting the stunning Stave church in Heddal, 
				dating from the early 13th century this is the largest stave church in Norway.</p>

				<p>Our trip kept going taking the summer road between Sauland and Rjukan. At this point it was already 
				very cloudy, rainy and windy and we stayed a couple of days without seeing the face of the sun. The road 
				went up to 1200m high and we were driving at 30km/h through the clouds until we reached the starting point 
				of the Gaustatoppen hike. There we parked and got all set to do this nearly 5km hike. The weather conditions 
				were not very suitable, the clouds were just around us and the visibility was very poor, also the wind 
				and rain kept coming and going. Anyway, up we went following the <strong style="color: red">T</strong> letter painted in red on rocks, marking 
				the trail we should go. The higher we went, the colder it got, also the wind and rain kept getting stronger 
				and the weather didn’t look like it was going to clear up anytime soon. After a bit over one hour of hike 
				we met a bunch of people coming down with news that the weather indeed wasn’t going to get better and it 
				would possibly start to thunder. So unfortunately we couldn’t do the Gaustatoppen this time, and down we went. 
				As we reached the bottom, things were different, not weather-wise, but the amount of people that were down 
				there and some balloons and flags. We didn’t know, but the last stage of the Norseman triathlon was taking place there.</p>

				<p>All soaked, we returned to the car and changed to dry and warm clothes then drove down to Rjukan. 
				Rjukan is a little town located in between huge mountains where the sun doesn’t reach very often.</p>
				
				<p>From Rjukan we drove down in the direction of Dalen where we had some trouble with the car going up 
				some very steep and curvy roads, then continuing until we reached Flateland camping in the Setesdal region. 
				In this camping place we had the pleasure to experience a night under a Lavvu, a  traditional tent used by 
				the Sami people with a fire in the middle, tables around with people chatting and drinking and 
				<a class="post-text" href="http://goo.gl/Y0tQTB" target="_blank">a fiddle 
				player playing traditional songs</a> of the regions nearby, full of history.</p>
				
				<p>The next day we kept driving west, staying the night in the high and mountainous region near 
				Rosskreppfjorden in a sheep farm.</p>

				<p>And further down until we reached Jørpeland. Jørpeland was the only place we stayed more than one night 
				because we wanted to do the hike up to the Preikestolen and have some time to chill.
				The hike was very nice but a bit exhausting, but luckily we had a great weather and were able to see 
				everything very well and experience the Preikestolen fully.</p>

				<p>The next two days were once again rainy and windy. We drove down to Stavanger and visited the 
				old part of town and harbour then kept going back east following the 
				<a class="post-text" href="http://www.visitnorway.com/uk/where-to-go-uk/south/what-to-do-in-southern-norway/travel-tips-for-southern-norway/north-sea-road/" target="_blank">North Sea Route - Nordsjøvegen</a>
				and stayed the night at the end of a farm facing the ocean. The next day the sun and the warmth 
				were back and we were able to enjoy the coast and stop for a swim. The sea in the south was not 
				as warm as the sea in Sweden, but the crystal clear water and white sand were very inviting.</p>

				<p>We kept following the North Sea route then changing to the main highway until we reached Kristiansand, 
				where we spent the night and took the ferry back to Denmark the next morning. The 2 hour long ferry ride 
				was quite shaky and I was glad to reach ground again in Hirtshals. From there we drove more 500km down to 
				Hamburg and reached home safe and sound.</p>
								
				<h3>After thoughts</h3>
				
				<p>&dash; Scandinavia, and especially Norway, is quite expensive but very worth the visit and effort. 
				If you don’t eat out everyday and camp wild, you can spare a lot of money.</p>
				
				<p>&dash; Everyone we met and talked to, spoke either good or fluent english and were always very friendly and helpful.</p> 
				
				<p>&dash; Driving in Denmark, Sweden and Norway seemed quite chilled (even though I can’t drive :D ). 
				In Norway the speed limit didn’t go over 90km/h and at some points we had roads with 40km/h of speed limit.</p> 
				
				<p>&dash; Don’t park in the centre of Oslo ;)</p>
