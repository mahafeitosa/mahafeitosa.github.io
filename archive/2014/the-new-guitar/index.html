				<h1 class="post-title">The new guitar</h1>
				
				<p>This past week I've been spending many hours with my new acquisition, analysing its curves, appreciating the little details and of course, playing a lot. I bought a PRS, and as expected, I am loving it.</p>

				<p>Since 2009, when I first had contact with the PRS, I've been dreaming of owning one of these guitars. When I first tried it, the guitar felt just right, not just the grip and shape but also the tone range, which was one of the main aspects that made me like it even more. In December 2013 I started trying out different models in a guitar shop here in Hamburg. I became a constant visitor of the shop, and at least once a month I would go there, grab one guitar, sit down and play. Look at every single corner of the instrument, feel every single piece it contained. Slowly this model started selling out and no new ones were coming in, when I decided to buy it, the colour I wanted was also sold out in this shop. Luckily I found the same one model and colour in an online shop here in Germany. That was the one. I didn't wait any longer and, after exchanging a few emails with one of the workers there and clearing up some doubts, I bought it.</p>

				<p>This is a PRS SE Custom 24 Quilt Top in the Emerald Green colour. The SE model is a more affordable line of guitars made by the American guitar manufacturer and luthier <a class="link-underline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_Guitars" target="_blank">Paul Reed Smith</a>. This Quilt Top model was released in 2013 limited to 200 guitars in 5 different colours sold exclusively in Europe. The SE also comes with a handy and comfortable PRS gig bag.</p>
