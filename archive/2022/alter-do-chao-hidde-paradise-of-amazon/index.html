				<p>The longer we stayed in the biggest city of Amazonas - Manaus, the more we felt like we needed to keep on moving. We definitely enjoyed our stay, spending time with our great friend and host Marx, visiting the city and so on. We ended up staying longer than expected mostly due to the three of us catching Chikungunya, a virus spread by infected mosquitoes that leaves you with headaches, fever, joint pain and feeling weak in general. After four days recovering, we were ready to go back to the boat life and continue our journey up the Amazon river.</p>

				<h3>Getting there</h3>
				
				<p>Our next destination was already written in our minds after a suggestion given by someone we met on our previous boat travel. The place: Alter do Chão. To get there we took one more boat, from Manaus to Santarém. Our boat was called Golfinho do Mar II and it took us one day and one night or about 30 hours to reach our destination. The boat itself was very packed, in fact, it was the most packed boat we got in our travels. Our hammock placements were on the far back of the second floor, near toilets and water dispenser but also where all the noise from the engines were. Here all the three main meals had to be purchased on board and on the upper deck there is also a small snack bar with a few more options of sandwiches or cup noodles.</p>
				
				
				<h3>Boat logistics — Manaus Santarém</h3>
				
				<ul>
					<li>&rsaquo; Boat name: Golfinho do Mar II</li>
					<li>&rsaquo; Ticket price: R$170</li>
					<li>&rsaquo; Travel times: Boat departs at 12:30, you sleep one night and arrive the next day at around 17:00</li>
					<li>&rsaquo; Meals: R$10 for breakfast, R$15 for soup and R$20 for lunch / dinner</li>
					<li>&rsaquo; Amenities included: Drinkable water, well maintained toilets and shower</li>
				</ul>		
				
				<p>Not very long after leaving Manaus the boat passes by the meeting of the waters, a very interesting phenomenon that happens when the two rivers meet, <em>Rio Negro</em> and <em>Rio Amazonas</em>, one is a rather dark coloured, cold stream and the other a more <em>Café au Lait</em> colour (coffee mixed with milk) and warmer. The two do not mix for a great extension, instead they just hit each other stubbornly while all sorts of ships and boats go by.</p>
				
				<p>The rest of the travel is more of the incredible views of lush forests from both sides, passing by tiny settlements above the water and eventual bigger port towns, where the boat makes stops that vary from 15 minutes to one hour. As the sun started to set the next day, we approached the city of Santarém. From the distance it looks like a mini version of Manaus, with lots of small to medium sized boats going by or moored by the promenade as well as very big cargo ships going up or down the stream.</p>

				<h3>Santarém</h3>
				
				<p>The city of Santarém itself was not our final destination, so we did not linger here for too long. Just enough to find a Main Street and catching the local bus to Alter do Chão. The impression we had from our 30 minutes walk to the centre is that it seemed a more relaxed version of Manaus. Not super loud, not super packed. Streets were quite wide too and the weather was the same hot and humid special blend.</p>
				
				<h3>Alter do Chão</h3>
				
				<p>In Santarém you only need to take a local bus, number 19, with the name Alter do Chão in the front, ticket price of R$3,90 and that’s it… well, kind of. The ride is a bit over one hour through the city and then through a highway wriggled between forests. At around 19:30 we finally reached the village and our hostel, where we stayed for the next four nights.</p>
				
				<p>The village instantly passes a very tranquil atmosphere, with its chessboard style unpaved streets and many blocks completely covered in mini dense forests. The houses here goes from the small and old fisherman sort of dwelling all the way up to the big two story holiday homes. The village centre is a small but cosy square filled with well placed trees and benches, where hippies sell their handcraft and small food stands feed the tourists with Pastel of different flavours, juices and sandwiches. Here is also where you find the main supermarket and, what is probably the main attraction of the place, the waterfront. The view instantly makes you go wow! A great extension of a river with very clean water, across, what seems to be a green island with a hill in the middle and in between, a line of scattered trees and houses half covered by the high tide of the river trying to form a line connecting these two realities.</p>

				<p>Our hostel was also something very unique. It was more like a small closed jungle community with white sand paths leading you to the small wooden houses or the shared facilities. The sky was barely visible above all the tree tops covering the area. Trees that sometimes had their own tree houses serving as another room of the hostel.</p>
				
				<p>On our first day we spent a good amount of hours playing and refreshing our souls in the very clean and warm waters of the river. Since the tide was still a bit high, the main attraction of Alter do Chão, the sand path joining the two lands, was almost completely hidden by the tide only leaving over the surface a few small houses and trees. By the river we found a nice spot away from the crowds, near some trees coming up on the surface and there we spent hours playing around.</p>
				
				<p>The next day we were set to cross the river, with a small peddle boat (R$10), and do an easy level hike into the dry vegetation and then up the hill, which is visible from the town. The hill itself, <a class="link-underline" href="https://www.google.com.br/travel/entity/key/ChkIvdrT-uqrnJkEGg0vZy8xMWM1YnEyMzAwEAQ?ei=OO1ZYaPZJYqA2gG3n6ygAg&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwjw8Oiz0vv5AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&ts=CAESABoECgIaACoECgAaAA" target="_blank">Serra Ibitira Piroca</a>, is about 100m high and it gives you an incredible 360° view of the surrounding areas, Alter do Chão and the Amazon river.</p>

				<p>On the following day, after waking up early and eating tasty tapioca with eggs and cheese for breakfast, we went on another really nice adventure. Back in the river we rented kayaks for the whole day (R$50 per person) and that was, for sure, the best way to spend R$50. First we kayaked into the large Lago Verde, the Green Lake. Going near the shore, seeing a lot of different trees and plants, all half covered by the high tide waters and at some point, where the lake was very quiet, suddenly dolphins started to come up very close to us, doing their breathing sounds catching fish. We stopped kayaking and simply observed such incredible moment.</p>
					
				<p>It took us around four hours to go around the lake, stopping sometimes to grab a fruit or just to chill under the light rain. We came back to where we started for a short swim and food break and then continued to the other side following the Tapajós river. Here we wanted to go into another small lake we saw the previous day from the top of the hill on our hike. At about 17:00 we were back to the kayak rental grabbing our stuff and doing the paddle boat crossing back to Alter do Chão with huge smiles in our faces and the adventure bar completely fulfilled.</p>

				<p>On our last day we had to go to Santarém to purchase our tickets and do the last preparations for our next adventure, which this time would be by land, with buses, instead of by the river. At 18:00 we were fully packed and waiting for the bus that took us on a crazy, eventful and long ride further up north, to the capital of Maranhão. São Luís.</p>
