				<h1 class="post-title">Chicama - The longest wave</h1>
				
				<p><img src="/archive/2022/chicama-the-longest-wave/img/IMG_1238.jpg" alt="Chicama - The longest wave"></p>
				
				<p>Ever since we thought of visiting Peru's coast, Chicama was always on the top of our to-go places mainly due to the legendary status of <em>longest left waves in the world</em>. And that's where we headed next.</p>
				
				<p>Our days in Huanchaco were very enjoyable, with our first surf in pacific waters, making some beautiful friendships and also enjoying the easy going life of a desert coastal town. As time passed, we felt that the road was calling us again to guide us to our next destination: Puerto Malabrigo &dash; commonly known as Chicama.</p>
				
				<p>After following our morning routines, packing our bags and saying a long and heartfelt good bye to our hosts and friends, we jumped into our known colectivo and headed back to Trujillo. There we didn't waste time; purchased some essentials and found our next colectivo to Puerto Malabrigo - a long van with 25 or so seats for the cost of 9 Soles per person. The drive started by getting stuck at the crazy traffic on the exit of Trujillo direction airport. After almost 20 minutes of no movement, our transport finally reached the Peruvian Panamericana highway and from there on the drive was very smooth and fast. Deserts and sand dunes painted the views on both sides of our windows as we passed by tiny road-side towns and settlements. Half way through the ride the landscape changed to vast green fields of what looked like corn and sugar cane.</p>
				
				<p>Arriving at Puerto Malabrigo a.k.a. Puerto Chicama or simply, Chicama, we headed straight to our hotel… yes, hotel haha! How come, you may be asking? Quick story time: on our last day in Huanchaco, as I was up in the roof getting coffee ready, our newly acquainted neighbour sat and we struck up a nice conversation about our travels, surf and the town we were in. At the end, after asking where we were staying in Chicama and me answering &dash; we will be staying in our tents on the beach, he kindly offered us his hotel reservation for the next three days because he decided to travel more in land and not back to Chicama. Awestruck I struggled to accept the kind offer but that was in vain; our friend was already emailing the hotel and changing the booking reservations to my name.</p>
				
				<p>So back to Chicama; checking in and unloading our backs, we came straight back to the streets to find some food not knowing how empty and ghost-like town it would be on a Sunday at 15:30. After a late but welcomed lunch we strolled slowly by the beach and found a nice spot on top of a hill to watch the sun hiding behind the pacific's horizon.</p>

				<h3>The town and the people</h3>
				
				<p>Chicama is a very small town by the coast. As told by a local, it is also known as Puerto Malabrigo or Puerto Chicama. The actual town (pueblo) of Chicama is further back and more in land. Puerto Malabrigo offers a dozen or so streets in a chess board style, having the main promenade street quite well maintained with nice spots with trees and seats overlooking the ocean. One street behind is where one can find most of the <a class="link-underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceviche" target="_blank">Ceviche</a> restaurants, grocery shops and the local market and one street more is where the colectivo terminal is located. As most coastal towns we've been in, the locals have a quite chilled way of living and always seemed happy to see us, foreigners, trying our <em>portunhol</em> abilities while haggling prices on the local market.</p>
				
				<p>The city lays on top of a tall cliff with its back to a vast desert populated with mountains and dunes while the front greets you with the Pacific Ocean. From the promenade it is possible to have a 180° view of the coast, starting from the right, with the long pier and all its fishing boats dancing slowly with the rhythm of the sea, passing by a long stretch of beach all the way to the left, where the mythical long waves come from.</p>

				<h3>The longest wave</h3>
				
				<p>It is certain to say that most foreigners who come to Chicama come for the waves. From the very beginner to the experienced surfers, short board, funboard or longboards, all can have an incredible session here.</p>
				
				<p>From the promenade it is easy to get down to the beach from one of the access points and then make your walk to the surf spots. The walk though, can prove to be a little challenge or, if you prefer, a nice workout. Not due to its distance but due to the constant winds coming down from the cliffs. Specially if you are carrying your surfboard, be prepared to hold tight to it and have strong legs holding you down to the ground. After a 20 minute walk you reach El Point, which seems to be everyone's favourite spot and where the long waves are more constant. Here the beach becomes a bit more rocky and to enter the surf you have to watch out first and mentally trace a path in between the rocks that protuberate from the water but this is only for the first couple of metres. Afterwards, jumping on the board and swimming in is usually easy going and you don't have to swim too far in to start getting nice waves.</p>
				
				<p>Our first surf here was really a playground. It was soon after a very good swell from a day before, so waves were smaller but still very rideable and strong enough to take you on a long ride. My very first wave was already one of the best of my life. On an 8 foot Walden funboard I didn't have to wait long at all until this perfect looking wave started to rise in the distance and come in my direction. The drop and ride were very smooth, cruising up and down, walking front and back on the board, the wave didn't seem to end. After almost one minute of riding, I looked back and saw how far away from El Point I was. I burst into the most uncontrollable laughter, screaming of excitement to the skies and oceans, jumping like a frantic baboon. Then I walked back to the beginning and done it all over again. Still incredulous of how fun and long these waves can be.</p>
				
				<p>For the girls, they also had their share of screaming-of-happiness moments. With a 9 foot longboard they easily went in and reached the break and had a good amount of drops while trying to stand up on the board for the first time. After a lot of practice at Atalaia Nova's surf conditions, this place seemed like paradise.</p>
				
				<p>The surf here is divided into several spots. All the way from the front of the town, near the pier - <em>Section El Pueblo</em>, up west to the end of the beach by this huge mountainous rock &dash; <em>La Punta</em>. From what I've seen, <em>El Point</em> and <em>La Cruz</em> tend to be people's favourite spots due to its consistency with waves, while <em>El Cape</em> and <em>La Punta</em> are more visited by those going by boats rented at the town. These guys usually go with their eFoil boards and kite and take advantage of the stronger winds out there.</p>

				<h3>Surf rental</h3>
				
				<p>Walking by the promenade you will find opportunities for surf board rentals and while all of the ones we passed by were filled with different kinds of boards and nice people greeting us, the one that caught our attention was the <a class="link-underline" href="https://www.instagram.com/malabrigo_left/" target="_blank">Malabrigo Left</a> shop, owned by Jesus a.k.a. <em>El Zorro</em>, one of the nicest guys we met so far in our travels. El Zorro is a Chicama local who has been surfing this beach for a long time and for the last 10 or so years have been running his shop renting surfboards and wetsuits. He is also a talented photographer / videographer and offer such services for groups of people who would like to have their surf documented.</p>
				
				<p>After our first conversations with him, very good energies were felt from both sides and from that point on we knew where we would be renting our gear for the Chicama sessions. Always with a big sun tanned smile on his face he is eager to talk, give tips about the surf points, about board shapes and sizes as well as places in town for tasty local food in affordable prices.</p>
				
				<p>At his shop you can rent a board for the whole day with wetsuit for 40 Soles and if you decide to rent for 3 or more days in a row, he will give you a very nice discount. We definitely recommend renting your gear at his shop, located on the main promenade up the hill.</p>
				
				<h3>Coastal walk</h3>
				
				<p>The beach curves and runs toward the west. The coastline's shape looks like the bite of the ancient giant: precipitous cliffs hang above the coral reefs. During the high tide the beach line disappears underwater and the dunes crumble into the ocean. So we hopped on the rocks and headed to the far cliff above the horizon, to our personal <em>edge of the world</em>.</p>
				
				<p>The journey takes an hour and a half, running through amazing beaches. The coastline is a curved line, so each beach is like a separate micro-world. Somewhere there are families of crabs, somewhere mysterious caves, somewhere you have to climb a sharp reef, and somewhere you can find a spacious shelter with a soft sand. After the string of beaches you reach the desert. Here the ancient power and freedom howl with the gusty wind playing with clubs of sand and you understand the wildness and incredible purity of spirit that lives here. The desert surprises with colours: hills and mountains are not sandy, but covered with small fragments of rocks and reefs. Probably centuries of contact with the ocean and the salty air has caused a chemical reaction that coloured the rocks into incredible dragon scales. Here you have to make a short but steep climb up a mountain range. From there you have an incredible view of the desert running away into the distance and the endless ocean, such a contrasting and harmonious love.</p>
				
				<p>Descending from the cliff, you come to a spacious sandy beach. However, the place is pretty rough for a picnic: the wind will easily carry away everything outside your backpack. So here it is better to walk, run and dance at the edge of the cold waves.</p>
				
				<p>The beach ends with a cone-shaped rock, suddenly sticking out at the edge of the land. It is here as a kind of monument to the divine game of God, so you can only wonder how it got here and lay hands in admiration and peace. A clearly visible path winds around the rock on all sides, taking the brave visitor to the very top. Here is the home of proud gulls, the temple of wind, water and salt. Here you think of the first wanderers who came to the distant lands in the hope of finding shelter. And goosebumps of awe and primal fear appear on your skin, while such a mighty nature haul from the all sides. The trail also goes down, inviting the traveler to bow to the ocean on huge boulders. We did so: silently standing, smiling and breathing in the salty tears of the universe.</p>

				<p>All in all we were very glad we decided to stop by in Chicama. The beach, the waves, the contrast of desert and ocean so close by and, of course, the people we met and friendships created. Ten days were not enough in this paradisiacal place. However, the road was calling us and on we had to go. Another long bus ride and warmer sea waters awaited for us further north.</p>
