				<h3>Manaus</h3>
				
				<p>Manaus is like a bubble, huge bubble that hide the whole world inside. It is hot, noisy and bright independent organism in the middle of wild rain forest. Everything is moving inside: huge clouds that never rain, hot humid air, millions of people and even more cars.</p>
				
				<p>Arriving: our feet touched the ground, first time since 4 days on the boat. We arrived to the port located in the old part of the city. So firstly you are meeting colonial Manaus. Here old magnificent restored buildings are neighbours with the skeletons of once majestic castles, and the nature slowly takes them back, creating a mysterious fairy tale inside.</p>
				
				<p>Manaus is a ghost of colonial times. For the atmosphere of the city has nothing to do with Portugal. Manaus is a typical Brazilian chaos that rushes into your consciousness like a whirlwind, shaking all the senses. Your ears are trying to separate the shouts of people from the avalanche of music pouring out of every store, car, or just people's phones. Your eyes stumble upon a variety of faces, colours, price tags, and bright headlines. The street is a continuous movement, a kind of Brazilian dance of life, which at first stuns, and then remains deep in the heart for ever.</p>
				
				<p>So, there are a lot of different districts in Manaus: an old town with its cafes, bars, museums and jazz salons; Ponta Negra district with skyscrapers on the bank of the river, business modern buildings and huge shopping malls; and a lot of territory is taken by typical Brazilian districts of house with small shops and cafes around.</p>
				
				<p>The Old town is nice for early morning walk after having your coffee with tapioca or in the evening because of the heat - during the day the town turns into the sauna, it is 33°C degrees that feels like 37°C, so be careful and don’t get overheated! If you want some city life, Manaus will give you everything: concerts or theatre, old fashion restaurants or modern places with neon lights.</p>
				
				<p>If you want to get more fresh air inside of the city you are welcome to the beach of Ponta Negra. It’s around 50 metres of white sand with the area to “swim”. Why “swim”? Because there is a net in the water that doesn’t allow you to go more than 3 meters away from the bank, so it is more like swimming pool for kids, as you can only sit down in the water and cool down your body. But it is still a nice place to play volleyball or football on the sand and just hang out with friends having some traditional local street food.  A little bit farther there is a Marina do Davi, it is like a mini port for small boats. Such boats are here to take you to floating cafes. Here you can have food but as well swim, jump from a platform and then easily come back, as such places are equipped with stairs and even life jackets if you can’t swim and just want to chill in the water.</p>
				
				<p>Want to experience jungles not going far away from the city? Visit Museu da Amazonia <strong>MUSA</strong>! It is basically a huge territory with totally wild forest, but it has trails and signs, so you can walk without a risk to get lost. While walking inside you will find different expositions about local animals and people but not all of them have translations to English! There are two towers with a lot of stairs that take you all the way above the trees showing nice panorama of the forest.  It is a really nice place to start your meeting with the rain forest, as it is still pretty wild but safe enough to be totally relaxed and enjoy your jungle walk.  We paid 30 reais, which is enter for the whole day, but without the guide! So not all expositions will be included ( places with snakes and spiders and some parts of the forest you can enter only with the guide of the park). <strong>Note!</strong> If you don’t want to walk in heavy Rubber boots, come in closed shoes, not in sandals! As you can meet wild animals and insects, your feet should be totally covered. If you don’t have such shoes, you will need to rent Rubber boots there for 8 reais.</p>

				<h3>Presidente Figueiredo</h3>
				
				<p>Want to wash away the sticky sludge of a big city lost in the jungle? Head to <a class="link-underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidente_Figueiredo" target="_blank">Presidente Figueiredo</a> - State of Amazonas! 2 hours through the jungle, up and down the hills out and north of Manaus.</p>
				
				<p>Many rivers cross the valley here, forming beautiful lakes and many waterfalls. The terrain here is hilly, so mornings are greeted by fog and a pleasant coolness - perfect for a dawn yoga session and a jump in the fast river. Speaking of which, Urubuí Park is a beautiful place for it! In the morning it gains tranquillity and pristine silence. The river with its swift rapid current gleams in the sun inviting you to take a dip. Surprisingly, the bottom is devoid of sand - smooth stone and nothing more. It's safe to swim here, the locals say, as anacondas and crocodiles don't like the swift cold waters.</p>
				
				<p>Find a path in the woods going against the river current, walk for 15 minutes and, if you're brave enough, jump in! The bank is an intricate web of roots of various trees, so you can't gradually enter the water, you have to be brave  and dive into the embrace of the black river. Yes, the water is black, but at the same time it's very clean! The current will pick you up and bring you to the beach of the park. It's an incredibly beautiful experience; it's the moment that flashes before my eyes when I remember Presidente Figueiredo. Swim with the current, jungle walls on the both side, birds singing, and there is only you and the forces of nature.</p>
				
				<p>The town itself is small: a main street with cafes and restaurants, one-storey houses where locals live and tourists are staying, a football stadium, and that is basically it. But the town is not cheap, as this is where Manaus residents spend their weekends to escape the heat. Staying in pousada or a hostel costs from R$100 to R$600, the average price for a dinner is R$25. My opinion: one night is pretty enough here. Leave Manaus early in the morning, about 5 o'clock, have breakfast on the way and be here by 7-8 o'clock. Leave your backpack in the hostel and head out to explore the area! There are maps posted everywhere, showing waterfalls, rivers and caves. Choose what interests you and off you go! If you came by car, you can visit about 5 waterfalls in a day. You can also walk, as some waterfalls and caves are 2-4 km away from each other. Take a look at the caves! They are incredibly beautiful places which are mostly empty as people prefer to soak in the water in the sun. The water has been chiselling the stone for years, forming huge natural halls where the water drops play their trills.</p>
				
				<p>After spending the night at the hostel, you can use the first half of the next day to hike to the next waterfall and then head back to Manaus in the evening. Presidente Figueiredo is a great place to explore the jungle, connect with nature and yourself. I recommend going there on weekdays instead of weekends! This will help to avoid the crowds of people with huge speakers that play not the best music. Catch the moment, travel, live!</p>
