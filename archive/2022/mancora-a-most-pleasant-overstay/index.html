				<h1 class="post-title">Mancora - A most pleasant overstay</h1>
								
				<p>After spending ten days filled with surf, winds, sands and tasty breakfasts with beautiful people in Chicama, we decided it was time to pack our tent and backpacks and keep on moving towards north. North meant warmer sea waters and more tropical weather conditions; and that attracted us.</p>
				
				<p>Early rise and breakfast were followed up with packing our bags and cleaning our house on sticks, which had accumulated a considerable amount of sand we did not plan to take with us. The <em>colectivo</em> van was easily found on the main street and it would assure our way to Paiján for a 2 Soles fee. In Paiján we dropped at the main bus terminal and were instructed to walk a couple of blocks to our left and there we could find our next bus, to Pacasmayo, but little did we know that there was no actual bus stop or station but simply the Panamericana highway, bustling with vehicles from small tuk-tuks all the way up to big cargo trucks. By asking locals nearby, we found out that we have to hail the big travel buses and then ask them where they are going. After about twenty minutes and a few unsuccessful tries we got our bus for a 10 Soles fee each.</p>

				<h3>Pacasmayo</h3>
				
				<p>Our arrival in Pacasmayo was quite sudden. The bus simply stops in the middle of the highway and a man outside screams the name of the city, giving you a couple of minutes to collect your belongings and leave. If you happen to be sleeping or with headphones you might just miss your stop. At about midday we started to walk around the small city, starting at the promenade by the ocean. After more or less one hour walking the whole length and up the hills searching for a suitable spot for our tent, we decided that no good decision could be made with empty bellies, and so we headed more into the city to find a nice and affordable menu.</p>
				
				<p>As lunch was setting down in our stomachs, the three of us had enough time to process our walk around the city, the lack of suitable spots for camping and the general feeling we got, that it was not so much as we expected. Pondering about staying a few days and risk spending more money than planned and also staying in the cold Humboldt currents, or move on up north somewhere warmer. The decision was unanimous, up north it is. With backpacks on our backs once again we headed to the main bus terminal and purchased an overnight ticket to Mancora for 50 Soles each. Since the bus would only leave at midnight, we left our packs at the terminal's locked room and went for a walk around the city.</p>
				
				<p>We took our time to go into a big supermarket where we could find some things much cheaper than our previous location as well as some food we could eat for dinner before the bus ride. Then we walked to the beach, passing by many colonial style houses with very tall ceilings and windows that made us think more about the times when this place was in its beginnings. After watching another beautiful sunset by the ocean we headed back to the main square where early we had spotted a nice bakery. There we found a small round table that served as our pass time for the next hours until our bus time.</p>
				
				<h3>Mancora</h3>
				
				<p>Our wait for the bus was quite uneventful since we were pretty tired and way passed our bed time, which is usually at 20:00. Struggling to stay awake on the street side guarding our backpacks, we made up games of <em>how many steps do I need to cross this street</em> or <em>name a country with the letter G</em>.</p>
				
				<p>Into the bus we just had enough strength to allocate our packs in their designated spots and then sleep. We woke up around sunrise time and still had a couple of hours until our destination, so we just sat still, listening to music and appreciating the, still, desert landscapes outside the window.</p>
				
				<p>MANCORA!! Screamed the bus driver. Nine hours later we had arrived and that was our cue to get out. Like in Pacasmayo, we dropped just by the main <a class="link-underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-American_Highway" target="_blank">Panamericana Highway</a>. Same craziness of morning traffic trucks, colectivos and tuk-tuks. With local market marked in our map, we already knew where we would go for breakfast. One street behind and two flights of stair later and we are sitting preparing our oats and banana mix and ordering fresh made juices of papaya, strawberry and pineapple.</p>

				<p>After that we had a good amount of power to go on our usual walk in search of spots to camp. Not far ahead we already had reached the beach, which felt much warmer and alive but it did not take us too long to see that the ocean was quite high and leaving almost no spots at the sand for a suitable camping situation. Talking to nearby lifeguards we also learnt that the police usually goes around the beach at night to stop campers, since it is not allowed. With that in mind we decided then to search for a very affordable camping site.</p>
				
				<p>On Google Maps we marked three different camping sites, all located in a central area of the town. Sadly all of them did not leave us a good impression, especially when compared to their price tag for a night. So, we had one last camping site to visit but this one was further north, a 15 minutes walk from the central town. No worries, the beach is nice, the sun is shining, let's go… We walked by the beach and just before we find the street to turn, we spotted beautiful painted doors to what looked like a rustic beach paradise, with some people practicing yoga at the terrace. We looked at each other and knew we had to have a look.</p>

				<h3>The hostel and beach</h3>
				
				<p>Greeted by a big smile and fist bumps we met Jaime, the manager and caretaker of this incredible paradise by the ocean called <a class="link-underline" href="https://www.instagram.com/hostelmisfits/" target="_blank">Misfits hostel</a>. We explained our travel on a budget style and asked for a small corner where we could tent for some days. After some talks and analysis, we got offered a small but very cool room with beds for such a good price that we, without thinking twice, rented for the next two weeks.</p>
				
				<p>The hostel life turned out to be an incredible experience, our morning routines stayed the same but now we had a shared kitchen where we could do our early morning lemonades and breakfast and a terrace overlooking the pacific where we could do yoga and meditation. As the days went by, many travellers came and went and most of them we made great friendship, shared meals and songs by the campfire at night. With the ocean literally at our doorstop, a bare 6 metres away, meant we were lullabied day and night by the sounds of waves hitting the shore.</p>
				
				<p>In the mornings the ocean always presented itself very calm, undisturbed, as if it was lazily waking up as the sun rises. With winds at almost 0km/h, the pelicans become the centre of attention. By watching them flying low with bellies almost touching the water, following waves very closely and then gliding up as the waves break, you realise how great surfers they really are. Perhaps the best surfers since the beginning of times. Since the ocean was warm here, between 23°C and 25°C, swimming in the early mornings became part of our routine and the best way to wake up.</p>
				
				<p>In the afternoon, almost like clockwork, the onshore wind picks up strongly and this is when kite surfers have their fun. The skies get filled with colourful kites dancing up and down all across the beach front and only close to sun rise is when the wind ceases again.</p>

				<h3>The Surf</h3>
				
				<p>When we arrived, Mancora was receiving a nice swell that stayed consistent for the next 10 or so days with waves varying from 1 to 2.1m. Our first surf started at around 9:00 in the morning with a bodyboard borrowed from our hostel and with a 9 foot longboard rented from one of the three surf rentals located right in front of the point. This one costed us 30 Soles for the whole day; no wetsuit needed here.</p>
				
				<p>Because it has only one surf break, Mancora becomes crowded very easily and when the swells hit, many local surfers flock to the water. The waves are also shared with a varying number of beginners having surf lessons with their instructors, what makes the surf even more crowded. But the waters are large and waves are plenty, with a little bit of confidence it is possible to go in, fairly easily, find your spot in the outside and wait patiently for your turn. It is important not to get discouraged by the locals screaming ‘mine! mine!’ at every wave, they too once were beginners.</p>
				
				<p>While waiting in the outside for your wave you can chill and appreciate the beauty around you. Pelicans will fly low and land nearby, turtles will surface their egg shaped heads for some air and, if you are lucky, sea lions will make a majestic appearance. This day we were in luck, for all these incredible creatures made their own private show. While Dasha and I were far out waiting for waves, me on bodyboard and she on longboard, suddenly, not 5 metres away from us, this big round black shape pops out of the water. It takes me just a second to realise it is not a buoy but the head of a sea lion. Trying not to be very alarming I tell Dasha to look to her side. The head starts to float very fast in our direction and we can feel the adrenaline taking over our bodies. Just as it was about to reach us, the sea lion dives and disappears for a few seconds just to appear again in between all the surfers, where it stayed swimming and fishing for the next 20 or 30 minutes.</p>
				
				<p>Despite the crowd and slight competition to find your own wave, we still had some good drops and falls. We noticed that the waves were quite gentle despite their size, fairly consistent and well timed between each series. This allowed us to surf to the shore and come back in without a lot of swimming and diving.</p>
				
				<p>On the next 4 weeks we went surfing a few more times, mostly in the morning time, when the wind was very weak. Just like the waves, the crowds were also consistent, some days with 12 people, some days with up to 30 boards on the break, but still it seems like every one manages to get their bit of fun. After all, dropping the wave is just a part of the experience of surfing. The connection with the ocean and with your inner self, the appreciation for the clean waters, the marine life around you and the quietness of the sea in between series of waves are also a big part of the whole art of catching waves, in my opinion.</p>

				<h3>Under the water</h3>
				
				<p>One day, after meeting up with our friend Mohammed, who has been living in Mancora for a while, we walked the beach towards south in search of a spot for diving and seeing marine life. 10 minutes past the surf break you can easily see jet skis driving in and out of the ocean bringing the good tourists to a floating platform about 200 metres from the shore. There you can dive and see turtles, fishes and the occasional sea lion but all for a fee of about 35 Soles. Instead we borrowed the flippers and snorkelling masks from our hostel, took deep breaths and went on a fairly long swim close to the floating platform. It didn't take us long to spot our first turtles and even a sea lion. At first glance the magnitude of those animals, in their own habitat, can scare the beginner snorkeler for the first minutes but after seeing how gentle they glide in the water, you notice that if you are gentle like them, there is nothing to fear.</p>

				<h3>Town and people</h3>
			
				<p>As usual, we like to dive ourselves not just in the seas but also in the local busy life of the town's central areas. On our first day we already scouted the central market and nearby shops searching for the best prices of fruits, veggies and other things that composed our daily meals. The local people kept on the same kindness we've been experiencing since our first days in Peru, sharing smiles while we haggle prices using a mix of Spanish, Portuguese and gesture languages.</p>
				
				<p>The town is pretty much centred around the Panamericana highway, where all the buses arrive and depart from and where most of the business are located. If you walk one street parallel towards inland, you will find the market street with a lot of <em>tiendas</em> selling pretty much everything you will need for your stay at a fairly good price. If you walk in the opposite direction you will go through 4 or 5 blocks of mostly local homes, hostels and small grocery shops until you meet the ocean.</p>
				
				<p>Around the dusty streets a fair amount of tourists can be found among all the dogs and tuk-tuks. Most tourists we met were quite young, between their 20s and 40s, ranging from all around the world and coming to Mancora mostly for one specific reason; the party life. Before coming to Mancora we always heard how party heavy of a town it can be. In our four weeks here we did notice a lot of parties going on at bars and small clubs, but it did not feel like it was a party at every corner of every street. Perhaps because the high season was just beginning. Unfortunately, due to the fact we are in bed at 20:00 and not partying, we can't offer much tips and recommendations for night life, but if it is parties what you are looking for, it is for sure that you will find plenty going on.</p>

				<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
				
				<p>Mancora definitely caught us. Warm, deep blue and so welcoming ocean was washing our minds and souls three times per day, and kind people were share evenings with us near the cozy bonfire. Mancora is the nest for the “birds” of all corners of the world, but with huge bags instead of wings. It's a beautiful, bright community that can give you a shelter and amazing time. The weather here is constant warm the whole year with bits of rains during the winter time, so you can easily come here whenever you hear the call. Enjoy and keep exploring!</p>
