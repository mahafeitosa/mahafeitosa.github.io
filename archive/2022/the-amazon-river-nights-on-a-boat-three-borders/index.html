				<h1 class="post-title">The Amazon river - Nights on a boat - Three borders</h1>
				
				<p><small>Written by Dina</small></p>
				
				<p>Tabatinga is the first Brazilian city that meets you on the jungle border of Peru, Brazil and Colombia. It takes your eyes with diversity: first of all, diversity of faces, intonations and smiles. Brazilian people are such a contrast compare to Peruvians. Much bigger country creates a tight knot of the roots from all the sides of the world, while Peru maintains very similar, typical shapes in its “pottery” art.  The city itself is also very different. Block structure doesn’t cross the border, replaced by the long streets. Tabatinga is much bigger compared to Santa Rosa, with a lot of cafes, shops, supermarkets and hostels. It’s well maintained and pretty clean. But with the growth of the city, very loved by Brazilians cement takes more and more plants and trees - somehow locals prefer not to leave natural areas, that sometimes hearts your eye. We pretty easily found a hostel to stay for the one night, as we needed to have some calm time for rest.</p>

				<p>From the first weeks of leaving Brazil in the last time, our souls were missing local traditional food: tapioca and açaí. Tapioca, the starch extracted from the manioc/cassava root, can be easily made by simply spreading a thin layer of the starch on a flat frying pan. No oil  or butter required. After a few minutes and a couple of flips, the starch glues together forming a very tasty, thin, crepe like dough which can be eaten with banana, cheese, eggs, butter and so on. It is a staple of north and northeastern Brazilian breakfast. And Açaí. Oh Açaí! One of the amazing berries coming from the Amazonian palm tree. From the berries, a liquid extract is made and sold in bags of 500ml or 1 litre. With that, one can blend it together with bananas and served with other fruits, granola or simply eaten on its own.</p>

				<p>So, with the spread wings and without heavy bags, we went to find our long-awaited lunch with those witch-crafted dishes. As tapioca is served usually for the breakfast, our way took a bit of time, but finally we found a place with the tapioca for exactly last three portions! We were eating with the holy light and silence inside of our souls, making people around kindly laugh. The cafe was a small business of the very nice family, that gave us a lot of advices and super tasty breakfasts for the next two days.</p>
				
				<p>Yes, in the end we stayed in Tabatinga for two nights. On the first day we found out that the boat to Manaus already left in the midday and the next one was departing only in two days. So, our advice is not to have very strict plans and deadlines in your travels, because the real schedule of the boats you can discover only in the ports.</p>
				
				<p>As the higher forces put us in the front of the other, unexpected turn in our maze of life, on the next day we went to explore Leticia - Colombian border city. To enter Leticia from Tabatinga, you don’t need to have Colombian visa or stamp, because there is no control post between those cities. You literally can stay with one leg on the Brazilian side and with another one on Colombian. But it's better to leave Reais (Brazilian currency) in their homeland or change them to the local currency, Pesos. Leticia looks like a perfect combination of Tabatinga and Santa Rosa: it’s well structured and well maintained city, with beautiful colonial architecture and a lot of blooming trees and flowers between roads and promenades. As for us, it made an impression of much more touristic place, with more people, noise and colours. There we found better prices for fruits and oats to take them with us on the board. So, it’s worth to take a walk there, enjoy the city and find some goods.</p>
				
				<p>The next day called us with the siren of our next boat. In the port we were told that the gates for the embark opens at 10:00, but we decided to come earlier to avoid the queue. It was a good decision, because even at 9:30 it was already a lot of people with typical huge bags.  The port in Tabatinga is a different reality compare to Masusa or Ranza ports in Iquitos. It is a clean, spacious building with places to sit, office of Federal Police (where you need to check yourself to get on the boat), nice bathrooms, drinkable water and kind workers. But the most surprising thing for us was the boat.</p>

				<p>When we got on the ship, we literally started to run and jump around - it was a white-blue castle, breathing and moving. The boat was huge: first floor for the storage with an open long deck in the front, second and third floors for the passengers with the private rooms, big areas for hammocks, kitchen and bathrooms, and fourth floor with the bar and open chill area under the sky. It was like a touch of the fairy godmother and another 4 days in the magical pumpkin.</p>
				
				<p>The price of the boat was R$220, which is 160 Peruvian soles. So, two times higher price compare to Iquitos - Santa Rosa way, but for the distance that longer for 3 or 4 times, and for, honestly, much better conditions on the board. It was equipped with 12 bathrooms on each floor, and self-service kitchen, that provides you with 3 meals per day and water. Breakfast at 5:00; milk rice porridge, piece of papaya, bread with butter and permanently sweet coffee. Lunch at 11:00: rice, beans, macaron, chicken or meat and farinha. Dinner at 16:00; the same like lunch. Making this note again: if you are used to eat fruits, vegetables or light food, take them on the board with you!</p>
				
				<p>We’ve got places on the third floor that wasn’t crowded at all. At some point we were sleeping in our hammocks, at the other time we were making our beds on the floor with our sleeping bags. At 5 in the morning the queue for the breakfast was taking us for the 2nd floor like a sleepy snake. After getting our cups of porridge, we were serving our breakfast on the open deck of the ship, closer to the water and farther from other passengers. The deck became our own hidden place of dances, meditations and quiet talks with the great river. Yoga on the sleeping bag, chess on the balconies, searching for the constellations in the evening - and all of that surrounded by the ancient jungles, and power of life itself.</p>

				<p>Two nights in the row we were covered by the storms. River and sky - two deep mirrors and between them thunder catches the lightning, water hits the water and mystical snake bites its tail. It was a gift of the freshness, cleaning and incredible beauty of the morning jungles shuddering like a dreamy bird. At such nights it wasn’t really hot, so it’s good to have sleeping bag or warm clothes with you.</p>
				
				<p>Brazilian jungle villages and towns were surprising us with the bright colours and active life. Here, a lot of the settlements were floating on the water, not going deep inside of the forests. And in the same time beautiful towns were welcoming us inside with the wide streets going up and up by the red banks. All of them were well maintained and clean with the shadows and reliefs of the colonial memories and of course with the shining happiness of locals.</p>
				
				<p>Very suddenly, one day small towns were replaced by huge port, long deafened from the thousands of ship signals. There were no birds here, and inside the humming roads were going farther and farther to the forest. We arrived in Manaus.</p>
