				<p>The evening before the hike was whispering with totally different plans. We were about to meet some of our friends and climb to the ruins from the side of the small river, that could hide our steps from the security guys - tickets for tourists are crazy expensive! But morning probably didn't like the taste of our sweet story and spat out all our plans, sending us to the best freestyle journey.  So, after the good market's breakfast we decided to climb the Lord of the Dance, that in our minds is proudly called <em>Mordor</em>.</p>
				
				<p>To find the trail we went to the small village of Huandar on the other bank of Urubamba river. Local women sipping <a class="link-underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicha" target="_blank">Chicha</a> shrugged and muttered something about <em>impossible, unknown</em>, quietly adding <em>in sandals</em>, but one of them pointed in the sand road that was going up through the village and told us to follow it before we will appear on the trail. It was the right direction.</p>
				
				<p>All our way literally can illustrate the sacred trinity of Inkas: snake, puma and condor.</p>
				
				<p>The first part of our journey took pretty wide, good road going up to the mountain in zig zag, like a lazy snake under the sun. It was pretty easy walk, with smell of anise and fluffy fields of wheat around. The trail was going up, becoming more and more narrow and increasing tilt angle but suddenly after another turn it just ended. Vintage, pencil illustration: Three of us stand on the age of the huge crack on the mountain's belly. Trail says to go back, hiking application asks "how do you like the hike?" For the top &dash; the distance five times longer, in the bottle &dash; literally three sips of water. We see the trail on the other side of the crack. Coca goes back to the satchel, in the minds grows decision of coming back and trying to find another way.</p>

				<h3>Puma jump</h3>
				
				<p>After coming back to the wide part of the trail we found out that there was another turn to the right that we just ignored. It didn't seem to go up the mountain but after some time we saw the stone stairs on the sand which welcomed us to the next chapter of our adventure.</p>
				
				<p>That part of the trail for sure can be marked with the warning red colour "hard experience". The road had tilt angle at least 45 degrees and was covered with a splash of small stones, making us grab the grass to hold on the path and sometimes crawl on ours fours.</p>

				<p>It was really hard. The bottle was sadly ringing with the last sips of water, we were tired, but Maha was spreading around smiles and hope to find water little bit higher. After the small stop, we made another jump and suddenly we heard the joyful laugh of the spring somewhere very close. We literally ran like crazy mountain goats to the sound. And there it was: shining on the sun and playing with the small rocks, pure magical stream.</p>
				
				<p><em>I felt such a strong simple happiness. Unconditional happiness of life, that vibrates in every cell of the body, that dances with the heart of Lord and that can feel the smile in the tree's whisper. It was such a powerful reminder of importance of being present and ability to find the love in the corner of the eye everywhere and every time.</em></p>
				
				<p><img src="/archive/2022/the-lord-of-the-dance/img/IMG_0651.jpg" alt="The lord of the dance hike"></p>
				
				<p>It was a perfect place to have a rest and real camping in the nearest future but journey was calling us. Every trail seeks the steps of the brave one and as a confirmation, Maha stepped on the bright red snake, that for the universe's love and kindness just crawled away &dash; the down world was pushing us up to the sky. Higher on the path we found first sign of another human being &dash; chewed dried Coca. In some minutes first, abandoned for the fast look, shelter met us. It was a small hut made from the dirt and dry grass that, despite its pathetic appearance, could really save someone's life during a stormy night. The house was locked but through the holes we saw some plates, cups and wood inside.</p>

				<p>Then we entered paradise. Fields of the unknown plants were dancing around the huge lonely tree. It was an Atlas, who's shoulders was tested by the wind and kissed by the sun. Mordor amazed us with so many bright colours: they were feeling every receptor of our bodies, pushing away all unnecessary things &dash; we were speechless. And we were infinite.</p>

				<h3>Condor flight</h3>
				
				<p>The fields were surrounded by the wild. The path drowned and dissolved into their greenery, so we decided to get to the edge of the mountain and fields as well, thinking that trail can appear again. We were stepping into the soft soil between rows of plants &dash; the fields were hugging us softly, protecting from the bushes and cactuses around but they ended without any sign of the trail after, so we appeared on the side of the mountain, almost hanging on the thorn rocky wall with the thickets of cactuses above and in the front of us and with the wild mouth of the big crack below. Firstly we tried to go down, but the crack turned out really deep, so we started to go up in zig zag, holding ourselves on that edge of the world with every muscle of each finger. By the time we made some metres up, the rain and the wind came to take a look what is going on in their lands. Probably, they were surprised to see us and became really quiet not to scare unusual beings.</p>
				
				<p><img src="/archive/2022/the-lord-of-the-dance/img/DSCF3487.jpg" alt="The lord of the dance hike"></p>
				
				<p>Our legs and arms were covered in scratches and drops of dried blood. Lack of confidence in steps called treacherous tremor and tiredness came with the second wave. We were making circles. So we decided to climb higher to the rock with orange spot to see better and decide what to do. It was exactly that point, where universe gave us the space to make a move. That freedom of clear choice went to my legs and arms and I just started to climb the rocks with crazy speed, leaving Dasha and Maha down, to wait what I will find. And then the big, good path blinked between the bushes. One more jump and I was there. On the path of joy and celebration of courage. We were free like birds and we could see so far away. The mountain was us, and we were a mountain.</p>

				<p><img src="/archive/2022/the-lord-of-the-dance/img/DSCF3493.jpg" alt="The lord of the dance hike"></p>
				
				<p>That path probably used to welcome only warriors &dash; it was a line of hope on a steep wall, rapidly going upwards, surrounded by cactuses and sharp rocks. On the mountain you always can find so many different, new horizons: and so, a soft, light green field grew up in front of us. It was amazing place to have a break and enjoy the view. Our big tree suddenly became so small &dash; we made a good distance up. We left some Coca leaves for the Lord of the Dance, while he was singing with the grass and birds, and continued to go up. The field was replaced by a labyrinth of large boulders that seemed to hold up the rumbling forest just above. We made a stop there, watching how the sharp peeks were hiding the sun, listening to the howling coyotes and feeling that the break point was reached. Dasha and I told Maha that our energy was only enough for going down. So, we stayed on the big rock, while our mountain warrior went to greet the forest and search for the path, that could lead us through the big crack, closer to the sun light and bring us home.</p>

				<p>And then there was the way down... (to be continued)</p>
